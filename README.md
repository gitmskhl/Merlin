# Merlin
Scripting programming language

This interpreter is written in Java and implements the Tree-walk interpreter model.


### Run

There are 2 ways to run the interpreter.
The first one is using makefile.

```
make compile
make run [filename]
```

For example, if your source code file is called source.merlin, then run the following command

```
make compile
make run source.merlin
```

If you do not specify filename, the interpreter will start in prompt mode.
